## jenkinsfiles
  A Jenkinsfile is a text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins pipeline and is used to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications. It is written using the Groovy programming language and can be created in two types: Declarative Pipeline and Scripted Pipeline.

  **1.Declarative Pipeline-**
   Declarative Pipeline is a more modern and user-friendly way to write Jenkins pipelines. It provides a structured and predefined syntax, making it easier to understand and maintain.

  **2.Scripted Pipeline-**
   Scripted Pipeline is more flexible and provides more control over the pipeline, but it requires a deeper understanding of Groovy.
